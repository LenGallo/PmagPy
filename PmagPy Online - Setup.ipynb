    "# Welcome to PmagPy on EarthRef.org's JupyterHub\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is **PmagPy**?  \n",
    "\n",
    "**PmagPy** (Tauxe et al., 2016; [doi:10.1002/2016GC006307](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2016GC006307) is a software package including hundreds of programs and functions for analyzing paleomagnetic and rock magnetic data using Python. In addition to providing tools for the working paleomagnetist, **PmagPy** serves  as an interface between paleomagnetic laboratory data and the [MagIC database](https://earthref.org/MagIC). \n",
    "\n",
    "With the Jupyter Hub on earthref.org, access these programs is possible without installation of Python of PmagPy on a user's laptop.  Data may be uploaded from the users computer to the website, analyzed and then downloaded.  Data may also be imported from the Magnetics Information Consortium (MagIC website), analyzed and ultimately uploaded to the MagIC database.  Similarly, images created by PmagPy can be created and saved to the users personal computer.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Some rudimentary knowledge of how to use Jupyter notebooks and minimal knowledge of Python is required.  For the curious, there is a full course in Python available through the Jupyterhub (see Python for Earth Science Students at [jupyterhub.earthref.org](https://jupyterhub.earthref.org)).  For information on the science of paleomagnetism and rock magnetism, see the textbook at: https://earthref.org/MagIC/books/Tauxe/Essentials/.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is MagIC?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Magnetics Information Consortium ([MagIC](https://earthref.org/MagIC)) is an open community digital data archive for rock and paleomagnetic data with portals that allow users access to archive, search, visualize, download, and combine these versioned datasets. MagIC supports the international rock and paleomagnetic communities and endeavors to bring data out of private archives, making them accessible to all and (re-)useable for new, creative, collaborative scientific and educational activities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Jupyter notebooks and Jupyter Hub\n",
    "\n",
    "PmagPy online is entirely structured around a special programming environment called [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what_is_jupyter.html). A Jupyter notebook is a development environment where you can write, debug, and execute your programs.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Jupyter notebook anatomy\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks have two basic _cells_:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Markdown: for typesetting notes. This cell is an example of a markdown cell.  Here is a \"cheatsheet\" for markdown typesetting: https://medium.com/ibm-data-science-experience/markdown-for-jupyter-notebooks-cheatsheet-386c05aeebed if you are hungry for more. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Code: for writing python code\n",
    "\n",
    "Insert a new cell by selecting 'Insert Cell Below' in the drop-down menu under 'Insert'. Cell types default to 'Code' but the cell type can be changed to 'Markdown' with the box labeled 'Markdown' on the menu bar.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To 'execute' a cell of either flavor,    click  on the Run key  or select Run Cells under the _Cell_ drop-down menu.    \n",
    "\n",
    "### Upload and download from Jupyter Hub\n",
    "\n",
    "To upload data from a computer, click on the 'File' menu, select 'Open' and then the 'Upload' button.  Downloading a particular image or data file is similarly done by selecting 'Open' from the File menu, select the desired file, then click on the 'download' button. \n",
